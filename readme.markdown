# Welcome to Macgrab
Macgrab is a simple alternative to screenshot uploading software such as GrabUp (now dead) and [TinyGrab](http://tinygrab.com). Although it'spurpose is more for education rather than improving on it's competitors, it is still a perfectly suitable alternative.

# Why make something that's already been done?
Well why not? I love programming and especially in Python! Most of my inspiration for making this project in particular was my dissaproval ofTinyGrab's latest release: 2.0. For some reason, they decided it would be best to use links to a webpage rather than the original image, which was a minor inconvenience to me as I like to embed screenshots directly into emails. Since I had some free time, I figured it'd be fun to write a small alternative to TinyGrab in python and learn a thing or two about pyobjc and the imgur API.
